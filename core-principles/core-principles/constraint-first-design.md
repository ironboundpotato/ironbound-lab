# Constraint-First Design

**Author:** Kevin Gilbert  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Establish constraints as the primary stabilizing force in multi-model AI workflows.

## Overview

Constraint-First Design prioritizes **rules before creativity**.  
In AI systems, instability arises when models are allowed to generate freely without boundaries.  
Constraints create the structural rails that prevent drift, preserve intent, and maintain accuracy.

## Core Principles

### **1. Constraints Precede Execution**
Models must receive:
- Scope limits  
- Style requirements  
- Forbidden actions  
- Structural rules  

before any generative work begins.

This ensures predictable, stable outputs.

---

### **2. Constraints Are Binding**
Once defined, constraints are:
- Non-negotiable  
- Non-editable by the model  
- Enforced at every stage of the workflow  

Models cannot override or reinterpret constraints.

---

### **3. Constraints Enable Modular Thinking**
By reducing ambiguity, constraints:
- Improve role separation  
- Enhance orchestration across multiple LLMs  
- Lower cognitive load  
- Increase reproducibility  

Constraints don’t limit creativity — they **channel it**.

---

## Why It Matters

Without constraints, LLMs:
- Expand scope  
- Add unintended content  
- Drift away from user intent  
- Rewrite or reshape format  

Constraint-First Design eliminates these failure modes.

## Summary

Constraints are not optional or decorative.  
They are the **core stabilizer** that makes multi-stage AI workflows reliable, repeatable, and professional.
