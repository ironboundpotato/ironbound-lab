Ironbound Frameworks

Author: Kevin Gilbert (2026)
Purpose: A modular, role-based operator toolkit for building, testing, and stabilizing AI systems.

Ironbound provides:

a unified drift-governance architecture

operator-level command structure

multi-model workflow templates

debugging and recovery protocols

standardized stability tests

The framework is designed for precision, predictability, and repeatability across GPT, Claude, Grok, and Gemini.

Folder Overview
internal-physics/

Core conceptual model defining:

cracks

pressure

constraints

load-bearing meaning

This serves as the theoretical foundation for understanding why instability emerges.

multi-model-workflows/

Executable workflows for:

4-role GPT pipeline

GPT/Claude alternating refinement

multi-model stress test harness

These templates make the system reproducible for any operator.

ironbound-ops/

Operational tools for day-to-day work:

operator-commands.md

operator-checklist.md

operator-prompts.md

debugging-playbook.md

stability-tests.md

This is the working surface of the framework.

Core Principles

1. Role-based execution
Every task runs inside a defined role: Architect, Editor, Stress Tester, Polisher.

2. Constraint-first design
Stability is enforced by constraints, not creativity.

3. Minimal-correction philosophy
Fix the smallest broken section — never rewrite the whole system.

4. Drift governance
All outputs are evaluated against the Six-Demon Architecture:

role

tone

format

intent

scope

confidence

5. Multi-model alignment
Different models must converge on the same meaning without cross-drift.

Usage

Start with:
APPLY: operator-checklist

Then run a workflow:

architect

edit

stress test

polish

If instability occurs:
CHECK: drift

If failure escalates:
SYSTEM RESET
