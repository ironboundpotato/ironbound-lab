IRONBOUND LAB
AI Systems, Operator Protocols, and Applied Frameworks by Kevin Gilbert
🔥 Ironbound Lab

A workspace dedicated to developing AI systems, operator protocols, and practical cognitive frameworks for stabilizing multi-model workflows.

Created by Kevin Gilbert, a blue-collar machinist turned AI systems operator specializing in drift-control, multi-agent orchestration, and structural thinking applied to generative AI.

🧠 Core AI Frameworks
1. Six-Demon Drift Architecture (v1.1)

A diagnostic model for identifying and correcting the six primary destabilization modes in AI:

Role Drift

Tone Drift

Format Drift

Intent Drift

Scope Drift

Confidence Drift

Used for long-form prompting, narrative consistency, and multi-model stability.

2. Seven Immutable Constraints

A governing ruleset ensuring AI clarity, consistency, and obedience during high-stakes work.

Precedence order: 1 → 7
Enforces:

structural integrity

logical continuity

tone discipline

instruction fidelity

3. Ironbound Lockstep Protocol

A multi-agent coordination method enabling several AI models to operate in synchronized roles without drift.

Pipeline roles:

GPT — Architect

Claude — Logic Officer / Editor

Grok — Stress Tester

Gemini — Cross-Check & Polisher

Built from real-world experimentation performed while operating industrial machinery — proving its resilience under pressure.

4. Operator Role System

A four-role workflow to stabilize complex sequences:

Architect — designs

Editor — enforces rules

Stress Tester — finds failure modes

Polisher — finalizes output

⚙️ Applied Human Frameworks
The Internal Physics of Being Alive

A structural model describing human behavior using engineering concepts such as:

pressure accumulation

load-bearing meaning

distortion

access

cracking

redistribution

Used across:

narrative design

character psychology

trauma logic

emotional pacing

personal recovery architecture

This is the backbone of TB’s storytelling and AI reasoning systems.

🎬 Creative IP (Narrative Worlds & Series)

These projects demonstrate how the above frameworks are applied to professional-grade storytelling:

Breaking the Pattern — grounded drama on loyalty, violence, and generational repair

The Load — prestige sci-fi about time, consequence, and irreversible choice

The Last Witness — anthology psychological thriller centered on truth-collapse events

The Prompt — socio-technical thriller exploring systems, corruption, and exposure

🤖 Multi-Model AI Orchestration

Ironbound Lab develops stable workflows across:

GPT

Claude

Grok

Gemini

Each model plays a defined role within the Ironbound Lockstep Protocol, enabling consistent, drift-free multi-agent production.
