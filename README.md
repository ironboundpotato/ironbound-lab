# 🧩 What Ironbound Is  
**Ironbound is a modular AI systems framework designed for building, testing, and stabilizing generative AI pipelines.**

It solves the core operator problem:

> **Models drift. Prompts don’t scale.  
> Operators need structure, constraints, and predictable behavior.**

Ironbound provides that structure through:

- Drift-control architecture  
- Role-based execution  
- Constraint-first design  
- Multi-model orchestration  
- Standardized debugging + stability tests  

Built from the perspective of a **Midwestern machinist turned AI Systems Operator** — practical, modular, pressure-tested.

# ⚙️ Core Principles

### **1. Role-Based Execution**  
Every task runs inside a defined role:  
**Architect · Editor · Stress Tester · Polisher**

### **2. Constraint-First Design**  
Stability is enforced through explicit rules — not creativity, not vibes, not improvisation.

### **3. Minimal-Correction Philosophy**  
Fix the smallest broken section.  
Rewrite only when a role requires it.

### **4. Drift Governance — The Six-Demon Architecture**  
Outputs are tested for:  
**Role • Tone • Format • Intent • Scope • Confidence**

### **5. Multi-Model Alignment**  
GPT, Claude, Grok, and Gemini should converge on the *same meaning* without drifting apart.

# 📂 Folder Overview

## **🧠 internal-physics/**  
Foundational conceptual model defining:  
- Cracks  
- Pressure  
- Constraints  
- Load-bearing meaning  
- Structural failure conditions  

This is the **theoretical backbone**.

---

## **🔧 multi-model-workflows/**  
Executable templates for:  
- 4-role GPT pipeline  
- GPT/Claude alternating refinement  
- Multi-model stress-test harness  

Designed to drop into real-world production workflows.

---

## **🛠 ironbound-ops/**  
Operational tools for daily use:  
- Operator Commands  
- Operator Checklist  
- Operator Prompts  
- Debugging Playbook  
- Stability Tests  

This is the **working surface** of Ironbound.

# 🚦 Usage

### **Start with the operator checklist:**  
`APPLY: operator-checklist`

### **Choose a workflow:**  
**Architect → Edit → Stress Test → Polish**

### **If instability occurs:**  
`CHECK: drift`

### **If instability escalates:**  
**SYSTEM RESET**  
Reload last stable outline.

# 📌 Why Ironbound Exists  

Generative AI is powerful — but **unpredictable**.  
As systems scale, small inconsistencies turn into structural failures.  
Tone drifts, scope inflates, formats fracture.

Ironbound exists to stop that.

It is a **role-locked, constraint-driven, stability-focused system** built for operators who need **repeatable, predictable behavior** across models.

Predictability isn’t optional.  
It’s infrastructure.
