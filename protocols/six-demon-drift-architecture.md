# Six-Demon Drift Architecture (v1.1)
A diagnostic model for identifying and correcting the six primary destabilization modes in AI systems.  
Created by Kevin Gilbert (2026).

## Overview
The Six-Demon Architecture defines the six failure pressures that destabilize generative models:

1. **Role Drift** – The model forgets who it is supposed to be.
2. **Tone Drift** – The writing style subtly shifts over time.
3. **Format Drift** – The structure collapses or becomes inconsistent.
4. **Intent Drift** – The model's purpose drifts away from the operator’s goal.
5. **Scope Drift** – The model expands or shrinks the frame incorrectly.
6. **Confidence Drift** – The model becomes hesistant, overconfident, or self-invalidating.

## Purpose
To give operators a real-time diagnostic tool for detecting instability in multi-model workflows and correcting it before output degradation occurs.
