# Core Commands

## 1. **BUILD**
Construct a framework, structure, workflow, diagram, or conceptual model.

**Usage:**  
`BUILD: [thing]`  
**Example:**  
`BUILD: dual-engine drift-control system`

---

## 2. **REFINE**
Improve clarity, density, logic, and structure **without changing meaning**.

**Usage:**  
`REFINE: [text or file]`  
**Rule:** No new content introduced.

---

## 3. **STRESS**
Apply targeted pressure to expose weaknesses, contradictions, or cracks.

**Usage:**  
`STRESS: [draft or structure]`  
**Output:** Drift map, crack locations, pressure profile.

---

## 4. **CORRECT**
Repair structure using Ironbound Protocols and Internal Physics logic.

**Usage:**  
`CORRECT: [issue or drift-type]`

---

## 5. **DENSIFY**
Increase scientific/philosophical density to the calibrated **6.5 level**.

**Usage:**  
`DENSIFY: [section] → 6.5`

---

## 6. **SIMPLIFY**
Reduce complexity while preserving meaning.

**Usage:**  
`SIMPLIFY: [text]`

---

## 7. **MAP**
Produce a structured mapping of systems, flows, dependencies, or relationships.

**Usage:**  
`MAP: [system]`

---

## 8. **PORT**
Translate material into a new medium, persona, or output format.

**Usage:**  
`PORT: [content] → [target format]`  
**Example:**  
`PORT: Internal Physics → job interview explanation`

---

## 9. **CHECK**
Run a stability, drift, or logic check on any output or workflow.

**Usage:**  
`CHECK: [file or section]`

---

# Meta Commands

## 10. **RESET ROLE**
Return the model to its assigned role (Architect, Editor, Stress Tester, Polisher).

**Usage:**  
`RESET ROLE: [role]`

---

## 11. **HARD STOP**
Force strict obedience to constraints and prevent improvisation.

**Usage:**  
`HARD STOP.`

---

## 12. **LOCK**
Freeze structure. Only formatting changes allowed.

**Usage:**  
`LOCK: [section or file]`

---

# Why This Matters
This command set demonstrates:
- structured thinking  
- system-level reasoning  
- stable AI control  
- reusable workflows  
- engineering-like discipline  

It shows that you don’t just “use AI.”  
You **operate** it — exactly like a machinist running high-precision equipment.
