## Overview
Load-bearing meaning is the internal structure a person builds to hold the weight of their life — their history, identity, obligations, pain, and hope.

It functions like an internal scaffolding:
- absorbing pressure,  
- distributing emotional load,  
- and shaping behavior in ways that are often invisible even to the person carrying it.

Meaning is not abstract.  
Meaning is structural.

# Core Ideas

## 1. Meaning Absorbs Load
When external pressure increases, humans offload strain into internal meaning:
- “What this says about me.”  
- “What I have to be.”  
- “What I can't let myself feel.”  

Meaning stretches to carry the load until it can't — and then it distorts.

## 2. Private Meaning Creates Distortion
When meaning carries too much weight, people begin bending perception and memory to keep themselves upright.

This is not lying.  
It is **structural survival**.

Private meaning becomes a brace that keeps the person from collapsing.

## 3. Distortion Protects the System
When the internal structure cannot hold the load:
- context shifts  
- perspective narrows  
- emotional logic contorts  
- reality becomes selectively filtered

These distortions are attempts to prevent total system failure.

## 4. Shared Reality Breaks First
Once distortion grows large enough, it begins affecting:
- relationships  
- communication  
- roles  
- decision-making  
- trust  

Other people experience these distortions as inconsistency, defensiveness, or conflict.

But at the core, it is someone holding too much meaning-load, alone.

# Relevance to AI Systems
AI models distort for similar reasons:
- too many conflicting instructions  
- unclear intent  
- multiple role signals  
- tone instability  
- unresolved ambiguity  

These produce drift — the AI equivalent of meaning distortion.

Load-bearing meaning in humans maps to:
- context windows  
- hidden inference  
- model assumptions  
- pattern completion under pressure  

Understanding this helps operators detect drift早 and correct it while the structure is still stable.
