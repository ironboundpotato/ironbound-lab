# Internal Physics of Being Alive
A conceptual framework that models human meaning, pressure, and correction as a physical system.  
Authored by Kevin Gilbert (2026).

## Purpose
Internal Physics describes how people:
- store private meaning  
- absorb load  
- distort under pressure  
- create “lies as structural braces”  
- experience cracks  
- and correct themselves through access and redistribution of meaning.

The goal is to map these psychological and emotional processes into a structured model that can also inform AI stability, drift behavior, and operator control.

## Core Principles
- **Pressure accumulates.**
- **Load seeks structure.**
- **Meaning absorbs strain.**
- **Private meaning distorts shared reality.**
- **Lies act as temporary braces.**
- **Cracking is an adaptive signal.**
- **Access redistributes load.**

## Applications to AI
Internal Physics maps onto:
- drift detection  
- pressure accumulation in multi-turn conversations  
- meaning distortion through inference  
- operator-model load imbalance  
- correction pathways modeled as “access events”  

This framework supports the Ironbound Protocol Suite by giving it a conceptual engine.
