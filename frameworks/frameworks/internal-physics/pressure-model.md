# The Pressure Model
Part of the Internal Physics of Being Alive framework.  
Authored by Kevin Gilbert (2026).

## Overview
Pressure is the fundamental force acting on human internal systems.  
It accumulates when:
- meaning is unclear,  
- choices conflict,  
- roles contradict each other,  
- or private truths diverge from shared reality.

Pressure is not emotional weakness — it is structural physics.

# Core Principles

## 1. Pressure Accumulates
If not expressed, moved, or redistributed, pressure builds silently.

## 2. Pressure Distorts Meaning
Humans bend reality slightly to reduce immediate load.  
This creates the first deviation — the seed of later instability.

## 3. Pressure Seeks a Path
Like heat or water, pressure tries to move somewhere:
- into behavior,  
- into language,  
- into avoidance,  
- or into a lie that acts as a temporary structural brace.

## 4. Peak Pressure Creates a Crack
A crack is not failure.  
It is the point where the structure refuses further distortion and signals the need for correction.

# Relevance to AI Systems
Pressure has a direct analogy in generative AI:

- unresolved ambiguity = pressure  
- unclear role = pressure  
- format collapse = pressure  
- competing instructions = pressure  
- private model inference = pressure  

In both humans and models, pressure precedes drift.

The Ironbound Protocol Suite is designed to detect and relieve pressure early.
