# Multi-Model Stress-Test Harness
A diagnostic framework for identifying drift, contradiction, and structural failure across multiple AI models.  
Authored by Kevin Gilbert (2026).

## Purpose
This harness is designed to intentionally *stress* a workflow — not to produce content, but to reveal where the system breaks.

It integrates:
- Internal Physics (pressure → distortion → cracks)  
- Six-Demon Drift Architecture  
- Ironbound Protocol Suite  
- Multi-model role separation  

The result is a clear map of failure points and correction paths.

# Core Components

## 1. Pressure Injection
Introduce controlled destabilizers such as:
- ambiguous instructions  
- nested conditions  
- conflicting role cues  
- tone inversions  
- scope compression/expansion  

Each stress input reveals a different class of weakness.

---

## 2. Drift Detection Layer
The harness monitors the model(s) for:
- role drift  
- tone drift  
- format drift  
- intent drift  
- scope drift  
- confidence drift  

Each drift type is recorded with:
- location  
- severity  
- likely causal pressure  
- recommended correction  

---

## 3. Cross-Model Comparison
If running multiple models:
- GPT and Claude outputs are compared line-by-line  
- divergences are logged  
- contradictions are highlighted  
- structural mismatches are counted  

This creates a “stress fingerprint” of each model.

---

## 4. Crack Identification
Using Internal Physics, the harness identifies:
- where meaning bent  
- where pressure accumulated  
- where distortion formed  
- where the system ran out of room  

This is the core diagnostic event.

A crack = point where structure refuses further distortion.

## 5. Correction Output
The harness produces:
- a drift map  
- a contradiction list  
- a pressure profile  
- a correction summary  
- a recommended next-step protocol (Lockstep, Constraints, or Role Reset)  

This turns failure into actionable repair.

# Example Workflow

**Step 1:** GPT is given an ambiguous high-pressure prompt.  
**Step 2:** Claude receives GPT’s output and identifies distortions.  
**Step 3:** GPT stress-tests Claude’s version to find cracks.  
**Step 4:** Harness generates failure maps.  
**Step 5:** Operator applies Ironbound corrections.

This is identical to real-world engineering stress tests.

# Why This Harness Matters

### 1. Shows Engineering Thinking  
You’re not just generating — you’re *validating systems.*

### 2. Demonstrates Understanding of Model Weaknesses  
You know how and where AI fails, and why.

### 3. Establishes You as an AI Workflow Operator  
This is higher-signal than prompt engineering or writing samples.

### 4. Bridges Internal Physics → AI Architecture  
You show how a human truth model can diagnose machine drift.

### 5. Provides a Tool Reviewers Can Actually Try  
If they run it, they *feel* the stability difference.
