# Four-Role GPT Pipeline
A structured, drift-resistant workflow based on the Operator Role System.  
Authored by Kevin Gilbert (2026).

## Overview
This pipeline turns a single large language model into a coordinated four-person team by switching the model into specialized roles with strict constraints.

The sequence is:

1. **Architect**  
2. **Editor**  
3. **Stress Tester**  
4. **Polisher**

Each stage enforces scope, prevents drift, and corrects structural or semantic weaknesses before the next stage begins.

---

# Stage 1 — Architect
**Purpose:** Establish structure, intent, constraints, and required tone.

Inputs:
- operator purpose  
- task boundaries  
- format rules  
- tone requirements  

Outputs:
- structured outline  
- section definitions  
- constraint set  

Drift Risks:
- overbuilding  
- expanding scope  
- inventing meaning

Containment:
- Ironbound Lockstep Protocol  
- Seven Immutable Constraints

---

# Stage 2 — Editor
**Purpose:** Improve clarity, density, logic, and structure without altering meaning.

Inputs:
- Architect’s structured output  

Operations:
- sharpening reasoning  
- improving transitions  
- correcting errors  
- enforcing formatting rules  

Forbidden:
- reframing ideas  
- altering meaning  
- introducing new content

---

# Stage 3 — Stress Tester
**Purpose:** Break the work on purpose.

Inputs:
- Editor’s refined version  

Operations:
- identifying contradictions  
- pressure testing assumptions  
- revealing structural weaknesses  
- evaluating stability under distortion  

Outputs:
- list of failures  
- pressure map  
- corrective recommendations  

Forbidden:
- fixing the work  
- polishing  
- toning things down

---

# Stage 4 — Polisher
**Purpose:** Final refinement.

Inputs:
- Editor’s content + Stress Tester’s findings  

Operations:
- smoothing language  
- tightening phrasing  
- final tone pass  
- preparing for publication  

Forbidden:
- restructuring  
- changing logic  
- reframing meaning

# Why This Pipeline Works
- **Role containment** prevents drift.  
- **Controlled handoffs** reduce pressure accumulation.  
- **Internal Physics** provides a conceptual engine for understanding failure points.  
- **Ironbound Protocols** enforce stability.  

This pipeline turns one model into a disciplined multi-role system.
