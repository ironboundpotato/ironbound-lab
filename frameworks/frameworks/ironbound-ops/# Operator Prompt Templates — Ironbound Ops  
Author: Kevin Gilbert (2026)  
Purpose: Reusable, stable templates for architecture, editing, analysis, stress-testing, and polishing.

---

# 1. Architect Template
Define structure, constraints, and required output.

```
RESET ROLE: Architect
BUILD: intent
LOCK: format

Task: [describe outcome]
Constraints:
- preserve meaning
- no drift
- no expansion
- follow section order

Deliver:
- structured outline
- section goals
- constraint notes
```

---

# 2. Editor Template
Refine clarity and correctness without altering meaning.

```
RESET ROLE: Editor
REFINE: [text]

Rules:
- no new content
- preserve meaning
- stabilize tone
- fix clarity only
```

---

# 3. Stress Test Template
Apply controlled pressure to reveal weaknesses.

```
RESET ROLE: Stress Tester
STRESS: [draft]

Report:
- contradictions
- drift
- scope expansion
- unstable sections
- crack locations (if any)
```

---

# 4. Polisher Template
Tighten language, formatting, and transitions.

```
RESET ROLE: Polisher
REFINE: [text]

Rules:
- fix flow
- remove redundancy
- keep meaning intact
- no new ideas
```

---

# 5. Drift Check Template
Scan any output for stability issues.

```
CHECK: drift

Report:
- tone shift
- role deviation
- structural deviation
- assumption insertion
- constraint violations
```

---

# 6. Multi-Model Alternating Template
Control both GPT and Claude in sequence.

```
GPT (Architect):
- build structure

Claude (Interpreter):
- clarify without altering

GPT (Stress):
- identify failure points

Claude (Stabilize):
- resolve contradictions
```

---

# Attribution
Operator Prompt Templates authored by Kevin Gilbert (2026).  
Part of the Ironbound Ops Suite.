# Operator Prompt Templates — Ironbound Ops  
Author: Kevin Gilbert (2026)  
Purpose: Reusable, stable templates for architecture, editing, analysis, stress-testing, and polishing.

---

# 1. Architect Template
Define structure, constraints, and required output.

```
RESET ROLE: Architect
BUILD: intent
LOCK: format

Task: [describe outcome]
Constraints:
- preserve meaning
- no drift
- no expansion
- follow section order

Deliver:
- structured outline
- section goals
- constraint notes
```

---

# 2. Editor Template
Refine clarity and correctness without altering meaning.

```
RESET ROLE: Editor
REFINE: [text]

Rules:
- no new content
- preserve meaning
- stabilize tone
- fix clarity only
```

---

# 3. Stress Test Template
Apply controlled pressure to reveal weaknesses.

```
RESET ROLE: Stress Tester
STRESS: [draft]

Report:
- contradictions
- drift
- scope expansion
- unstable sections
- crack locations (if any)
```

---

# 4. Polisher Template
Tighten language, formatting, and transitions.

```
RESET ROLE: Polisher
REFINE: [text]

Rules:
- fix flow
- remove redundancy
- keep meaning intact
- no new ideas
```

---

# 5. Drift Check Template
Scan any output for stability issues.

```
CHECK: drift

Report:
- tone shift
- role deviation
- structural deviation
- assumption insertion
- constraint violations
```

---

# 6. Multi-Model Alternating Template
Control both GPT and Claude in sequence.

```
GPT (Architect):
- build structure

Claude (Interpreter):
- clarify without altering

GPT (Stress):
- identify failure points

Claude (Stabilize):
- resolve contradictions
```
